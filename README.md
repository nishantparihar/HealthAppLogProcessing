# Health App Log Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing health application logs from an Android smartphone. The analysis focuses on tracking steps data for two days (2017-12-23 and 2017-12-24). The code uses pandas for data manipulation and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization.

## Code Overview

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook and covers the following key steps:

1. Importing and reading the dataset.
2. Data preprocessing and extraction of steps details.
3. Hourly and minute-wise analysis of steps data.
4. Visualization of results using bar and line charts.
